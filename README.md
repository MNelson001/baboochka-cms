BABOOCHKA CMS

-- Build / Configure / Deploy Progressive Web Applications using NextJS

Development:
  To start development:
    - npm install
    - npm run dev

    This will start the `NextJS` dev server on localhost:3000

    Current:
      - Baboochka is in early stages and is **not** ready for production.
      - Development is focused on the generation of pages, templates, widgets and misc components.
      - Keeping components small and lightweight is key.
    
    Future:
      - Dashboard with live-preview
      - Deployment process
      - A bunch of other stuff --- ugh...
